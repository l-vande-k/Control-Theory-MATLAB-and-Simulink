This lab focused on tuning feedback gains of a coupled tank system. Students designed their own PID controllers with an intent to create fast, accurate, and steady coupled tank water level control systems. The proportional gain value was kept constant throughout the experiment while the integral gain and the derivative gain were evaluated in independent experiments using PI and PID controllers.
